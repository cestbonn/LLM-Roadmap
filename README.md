# LLM-Roadmap
A simple roadmap and project for LLM learners.

There has been significant progress in large models since the end of 2022, with a plethora of work emerging.  However, most of these developments come from top universities and research institutions, while many enthusiasts for large models donâ€™t even have access to a high-performance GPU to begin their exploration. Therefore, I decided to create this repository to start from scratch and keep up with the development of large models, from academic frontiers to industrial application. I hope to provide a learning platform for those interested in large models, but lack resources and experience in their work and studies. ðŸ˜Š

- `Chapter` tag is the main roadmap
- `M` tag is for model explanation
- `SP` tag is for special tech or trick
- `Papers` contains read papers
- `Others` massive undecided staff...
