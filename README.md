# LLM-Roadmap
A simple roadmap and project for LLM learners.

The story began when I attempted to find a summer internship related to Large Language Models (LLMs), but was rejected by most companies. The reason for the rejections was my lack of experience and deeper understanding in the field of LLMs. I acknowledge that there has been significant progress in large models since the end of 2022, with a plethora of work emerging. Undeniably, I had not kept up with those works. However, most of these developments come from top universities and research institutions, while many enthusiasts for large models donâ€™t even have access to a high-performance GPU to begin their exploration. Therefore, I decided to create this repository to start from scratch and keep up with the development of large models, from academic frontiers to industrial application. I hope to provide a learning platform for those interested in large models, but lack resources and experience in their work and studies. ðŸ˜Š
